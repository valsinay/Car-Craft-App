# ðŸš— Car Craft App 

Realised with `MERN` Stack
 
This is a car application where you can upload your cars and view other user's cars.

Accessing cars can be done by clicking on pages `Home`, `Catalog`and if you are a registered user, you'll be able to view your created cars from the `My Account` page.

The project has `Register`/`Login` functionality.<br/>

Non registered visitors can access the pages: `Home`, `Catalog`, `About`, `Contacts`.

If the visitor creates an account, he'll become user. The user can access the pages: `Home`, `Catalog`, `About`, `Contacts`, `Create Car`, `My Account`, `Edit`, `Delete` (`Edit` and `Delete` function only if the user is the creator of the car).

On the `Home` and `Catalog` page cars are displayed in card , containing information for the `model`, `make`,`year`, `category`, `engine` and `price` of the car.

The `Catalog` page also provides `Search` functionality where you can search by the make, model, year, category or engine.

In order to look more dynamic, the `Home` page shows 6 randomly chosen vehicles each time you click on it.

`Catalog`and `My cars` work almost the same.
Both visitors and users can see the `Details` button which redirects to the `Details` page of the certain car. If you are the creator of the car, you will see the `Edit` and `Delete` buttons.

Once registered, using the `Create Car` page takes you to a form which you can submit only after all the required information has been entered. There is a validation check if the make is a number.The year is a number between 1800 and the current year and the price is also a number. <br/>
`Edit` page lets you edit all the information and if its correct, gets you back on the `Details` page of the car.<br/>
If you wish to delete the car, just click on `Delete`.

The site takes you to the `Not Found` page if you try to access a non-existent url.
